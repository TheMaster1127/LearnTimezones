This is a project called LearnTimezones.

To run the app, simply execute "Main Menu.ahk." Make sure you have AutoHotKey (AHK) version 1.1 installed. You can install AHK v1.1 from here: [AutoHotKey Website](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

To update the timezone information with the latest data, run "Check Timezone 1.0 beta.ahk." Please wait until the script is no longer running.

Internet Explorer might pop up. When it does, select the first option and proceed. Ensure that Internet Explorer is available because it's how we obtain information about the timezones."

AutoHotKey v1.1: To clarify, my project using AutoHotKey v1.1 has only been tested on Windows 10. While AHK v1.1 is generally compatible with Windows 95 and later versions, including Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, and Windows 11, I've specifically limited the testing to Windows 10 for my project. It's crucial to consider the specific testing environment for my project's compatibility. AutoHotKey (AHK) is intended for use on Windows operating systems only.



Here is how the app looks like:

If I press the 'Start' button, we need to select some places to practice the time zones. For example, we can choose Europe, Asia, and Russia.

Then, when we press the space bar, we will reveal the country or territory. Then you can try to guess the time there. When you press again, we will reveal the time there:

Now, we can go back by pressing 3, and we can choose a country or territory again. But this time, we can only select one box and press the 'Check Timezones' button. Then, we can pick a country or a territory, and it will show what the current time is in the country or territory we selected. Also, make sure the app is updated for the best results because time zones change in different countries or territories throughout the year.

Now for example if we select Europe we will see:

Now, we can select a country or territory, and we need to know all the countries or territories that share the same time as the one we choose. For example, I will select my country, Bulgaria.

And here's how it looks as of October 20, 2023:

So now we can press 3 to go back to the main menu. Then we can click on the button, check DTS dates. And there we can select a date where we can see what countries or territories will change the time there. Also there is a tick box where we can see more details.

And that's all about the LearnTimezones app.
