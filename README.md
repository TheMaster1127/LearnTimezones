This is a project called LearnTimezones.

To run the app, simply execute "Main Menu.ahk." Make sure you have AutoHotKey (AHK) version 1.1 installed. You can install AHK v1.1 from here: [AutoHotKey Website](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

Internet Explorer might pop up. When it does, select the first option and proceed. Ensure that Internet Explorer is available because it's how we obtain information about the timezones."

AutoHotKey v1.1: To clarify, my project using AutoHotKey v1.1 has only been tested on Windows 10. While AHK v1.1 is generally compatible with Windows 95 and later versions, including Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, and Windows 11, I've specifically limited the testing to Windows 10 for my project. It's crucial to consider the specific testing environment for my project's compatibility. AutoHotKey (AHK) is intended for use on Windows operating systems only.



Here is how the app looks like:

If I press the 'Start' button, we need to select some places to practice the time zones. For example, we can choose Europe, Asia, and Russia.

Then, when we press the space bar, we will reveal the country or territory. Then you can try to guess the time there. When you press again, we will reveal the time there:
