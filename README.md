Internet Explorer might pop up. When it does, select the first option and proceed. Ensure that Internet Explorer is available because it's how we obtain information about the timezones."

AutoHotKey v1.1: To clarify, my project using AutoHotKey v1.1 has only been tested on Windows 10. While AHK v1.1 is generally compatible with Windows 95 and later versions, including Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, and Windows 11, I've specifically limited the testing to Windows 10 for my project. It's crucial to consider the specific testing environment for my project's compatibility. AutoHotKey (AHK) is intended for use on Windows operating systems only.
